# Doker
## A decidedly uninformed remake of poker

This is the official repository for the open source board game Doker. The rules are maintained in the index.html along with every other relevant piece of information. This project uses GitHub Pages to serve the website.

All contributions are very welcome but they are expected to always maintain or improve current readability as the rules should always strive to be as easy to understand as possible. This includes the page layout/design which has purposely been left barebones. Any pull requests that drastically alters this design is - as a rule of thumb - declined.

Any changes to the rules themselves should be thoroughly documented and justified.
