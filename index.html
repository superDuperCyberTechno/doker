                A decidedly uninformed remake of poker
                <br>
                Version 0.9
            </h2>

            <p>
                The original author of this game likes poker. But he does not know how to play it, neither does he intend to learn. Instead he chose to cram a bunch of assumptions into a whole new boardgame.
                <br>
                The vision was simple: It must be easy to assemble, learn and play.
                <br>
                The result is a game that doesn't use a deck of cards. Instead it uses dice and dominoes to (probably) create a refined and easier version of poker.

                <p>
                    First: Decide on a dealer. Place all dominoes face down on the table (domino pool). Every player receives 3 dominoes. Make a chip pool (10 chips for every player).
                </p>

                <strong>
                    1. First roll
                </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Dealer adds a chip to the pot and rolls the first die.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Everyone decides (including the dealer) if they want to participate - in a clockwise fashion, starting with the dealer. Any player that wants to participate adds a chip to the pot and plays a domino.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If no one participated, you go directly to 4. If only one player participated, he/she wins the round and you go directly to 4.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <strong>
                    2. Second roll
                </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Dealer rolls the last die.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every participant decides if they still want to participate - in a clockwise fashion, starting with the dealer. Every participating player adds another chip to the pot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If no one participated, you go directly to 4. If only one player participated, he/she wins the round and you go directly to 4.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <strong>
                    3. Verdict
                </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Every participating player - in a clockwise fashion, starting with the dealer - flips their played domino. The player with the highest valued domino (see <a href="#evaluating-dominoes"><i>Evaluating dominoes</i></a>) wins the round.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <strong>
                    4. Round end
                </strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If a round winner is found, they are awarded all chips in the pot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All played dominoes are added back to the domino pool. The domino pool is then shuffled.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If any player has no dominoes left, he/she can buy more from the domino pool at 1 chip per domino, using their own chip pool. Any chips spent this way is added to the next round's pot. Players cannot have more than 3 dominoes in their hand at any time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The player on the dealer's left is the next round's dealer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the remaining amount of chips is less than amount of players times 2 + 1, go to 5. - In a game with 4 players, the chip pool must have 9 or more chips.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If there are chips left in the pool, go to 1. If not, the game is over.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <strong>

                    Evaluating dominoes
                </summary>

                <h3>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h3>

                <p>
                    The main goal is to play the highest graded domino when compared to the 2 dice. The dice dictates what values the dominoes need to consist of.
                    The 2 values on the dominoes match one dice, respectively. - Thus, both domino values are always evaluated.
                </p>

                To evaluate a domino grading, do the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Check if there are any hard matches (2 hard matches always win the bet). A hard match is any number that exist on both domino and dice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Within any remaining domino values, determine soft matches. A soft match is any blank domino value, this always matches to the highest non-matched value.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                </ol>
