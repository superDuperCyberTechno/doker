            <h2>
                A decidedly uninformed remake of poker
            </h2>

            <p>
                The original author of this game likes poker. But he does not know how to play it, neither does he intend to learn. Instead he chose to squeeze a bunch of assumptions about the game into a whole new boardgame.
                <br>
                The vision was simple: It must be easy to assemble, learn and play.
                <br>
                The result is a game that doesn't use a deck of cards or middle-aged, balding guys with bowling shirts and sunglasses. Instead it uses dice and dominoes to approximate a refined and somewhat lobotomized version of poker.
                <br>
                The resulting game is - according to the author - better than poker.

                    <br>
                    The winner is awarded all chips in the pot.
                    <br>
                    All played dominoes are added back to the domino pool. The domino pool is then shuffled.
                    <br>
                    If any player has no dominoes left, he/she can buy more from the domino pool at 1 chip per domino. Any chips spent this way is added to the next round's pot. Players cannot have more than 3 dominoes in their hand at any time.
                    <br>
                    The player on the dealer's left is the next round's dealer.
                    <br>
                    Restart the round (go to 1).

                    Evaluating dominoes
                </summary>

                <h3>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h3>

                <p>
                    The main goal is to play the highest graded domino when compared to the 2 dice. The dice dictates what values the dominoes need to consist of.
                    The 2 values on the dominoes match one dice, respectively. - Thus, both domino values are always evaluated.
                </p>

                To evaluate a domino grading, do the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Check if there are any hard matches (2 hard matches always win the bet). A hard match is any number that exist on both domino and dice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Within any remaining domino values, determine soft matches. A soft match is any blank domino value, this always matches to the highest non-matched value.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                </ol>

                    If you're the kind of maniac that likes to play with real money, this mode is for you. Basically, all chips have a fixed monetary value and are supplied by players themselves.
                    <br>
                    On first roll, the chip is supplied by the dealer.
                    <br>
                    On first, - and second bet, all chips are supplied by the betting player.
                    <br>
                    At the end of the conclusion, players are allowed to purchase new chips with their own money.
                    <br>
                    If if player has no chips, he/she cannot be dealer or participate in bets.
