                <br>
                Decide on a dealer.
                <br>
                Place all dominoes face down on the table.
                <br>
                Every player is given 3 dominoes from the domino pool.
            </p>

                <strong>
                    1. First roll
                </strong>
                <br>
                The dealer adds one chip to the pot and rolls one die.
            </p>

                    2. First bet
                </strong>
                <br>
                Every player decides (see <a href="#evaluating-dominoes"><i>Evaluating dominoes</i></a>) if they want to bet on the outcome - in a clockwise fashion, starting with the dealer.
                <br>
                If a player wants to bet, he/she plays their chosen domino face down on the table and the dealer adds a chip the pot. The betting round ends when it loops around to the dealer.
            </p>

                If only one player participated in the first bet, he/she wins the round and you go directly to 7.

                <br>
                Every player with an active bet decides - in a clockwise fashion, starting with the dealer - if they still want to continue.
                <br>
                For every continuing player, the dealer adds one chip to the pot.

                If only one player participated in the second bet, he/she wins the round and you go directly to 7.
                <br>
                Every participating player - in a clockwise fashion, starting with the dealer - flips their played domino. The player with the highest valued domino (see <a href="#evaluating-dominoes"><i>Evaluating dominoes</i></a>) wins the round.

                <br>
                The winner is awarded all chips in the pot.
                <br>
                All played dominoes are added back to the domino pool.
                <br>
                If any player has no dominoes left, he/she can buy more from the domino pool at 1 chip per domino. Any chips spent this way is added to the next round's pot. Players cannot have more than 3 dominoes in their hand at any time.
                <br>
                Shuffle the domino pool.
                <br>
                The player on the dealer's left is the next round's dealer.
                <br>
                Restart the round (go to 1).

                Evaluating dominoes
            </h2>
            The main goal is to play the highest graded domino when compared to the 2 dice. The dice dictates what values the dominoes need to consist of.
            The 2 values on the dominoes match one dice, respectively. - Thus, both domino values are always evaluated.

            To evaluate a domino grading, do the following:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Check if there are any hard matches (2 hard matches always win the bet). A hard match is any number that exist on both domino and dice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Within any remaining domino values, determine soft matches. A soft match is any blank domino value, this always matches to the highest non-matched value.
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
            </ol>
